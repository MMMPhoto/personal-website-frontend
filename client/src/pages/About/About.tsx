          <p>As a creative thinker who is always learning, I love doing and building things myself, whether it’s home renovation projects, films, or websites.</p>

          <p>I’ve always been passionate about storytelling, which first led me to filmmaking. After earning a Bachelor’s in Film and Digital Media from Georgia State University, I spent several years freelancing in nearly every craft in the film and television industry in Atlanta, eventually focusing on the Camera Department. Working as a Camera Operator and later a Drone pilot, I honed my photographic skills learning to keep up with ever-changing technologies.</p>
          <p>Like many people, I spent a lot of time at home during the covid-19 pandemic, refocusing and reassessing. I started a garden, renovated my kitchen, and started teaching myself web development. After several years customizing wordpress sites, I wanted to learn the basics from the ground up. I later completed a bootcamp in Full Stack Development at Georgia Tech, specializing in Javascript ES6+, React, NodeJs, and RESTful APIs. </p>

          <p>Since graduating from the bootcamp I have expanded into new languages and frameworks. I learned Python and Typescript, and I have integrated mapping into numerous projects with the Javascript Maps API. In a world of ever changing technology, it’s important to realize that you will always be learning something new.</p>
          <p>In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my daughter Sidney and partner Sarah. I also love playing music and long exposure photography.</p>
